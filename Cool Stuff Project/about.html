			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p><strong>Whats up!!!</strong></p>
			<p>We are a group of people who are here to help and inspire others to be cool!</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Don't be needy. Remember, people who are cool are not needy or desperate. Instead, try to solve problems yourself whenever you can. If you are not needy, people will want to help you or will ask for your help. This quality attracts people. Neediness is a big turn off unless you're really in a tight spot.[1] This doesn't mean you should act invincible; just don't beg people for help, act like you can't be alone, or expect others to fix your problems.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Be yourself. It will be something that other people will look up to. You are unique, and you don't need to join a clique. Make your own friendships. Being cool is being yourself in an outgoing way, even if you are quiet. Just remember not to come off as sullen and passive-aggressive. Be true to yourself! Don't always try to be like anyone else by copying someone else's actions or style. Although trying out those acts is fine, if you do that on a regular basis, it's going to come out as fake. No good comes out of being someone you are not. Live life for who you are. Don't lose sight of yourself or your morals. Being cool isn't about changing who you are, it's about being confident enough to let people see how awesome you really are. Remember, an original is always worth more than a copy. Be true to who you are and don't devalue yourself.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Practice self-disclosure. The more you disclose yourself the better you understand yourself. Self-disclosure is both the conscious and subconscious act of revealing more about oneself to others. This may include, but is not limited to: thoughts, feelings, aspirations, goals, failures, successes, fears, dreams as well as one's likes, dislikes and favorites.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Be friendly, but not excessively eager. Everyone loves someone who is outgoing, but nobody likes someone who is overly excited. Many people find someone who is overeager to be annoying. Try not to force yourself on people. Smile and strike up a conversation, but make sure you know the line between friendly and obsessive. When you meet a new person, take it easy, even if you think you're friend soul mates.</li>

	<!-- QUOTE -->
	<p>Here is a quite from topimnews.wealthmagnate.com:</p>
	
	<blockquote cite="http://topimnews.wealthmagnate.com/5-things-really-cool-people/" >
	1. Cool people exude joy. The first thing you notice about charismatic people is the spark of life. Whether they are saviors or troublemakers, they have a strong passion that triggers powerful emotions in those around them. Even in anger, they make people feel happy to join a cause. They show obvious pleasure in experiences, and they invite others to share in the experience they are having. Enhance your charisma by sharing your passions with those around you and helping their passions flourish.
